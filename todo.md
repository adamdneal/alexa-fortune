## Todo
- [ ] write interaction model
  - [x] needs unique invocation name ("fortune" is probably taken)
- [ ] write py to parse fortune file
  - [ ] may import to db/dynamo db
  - [ ] dynamo dones't have built in support for random access. quickest way is to use DescribeTable call (up to 6 hours stale though)
  - [ ] uses strfile format for quicker random access: https://linux.die.net/man/1/strfile
- [ ] write py for skill (started sample)
